# mis326_webprogrammingprojectcodes
This project created for my  mis326 Web programming course in this piece of codes we are responsible for 
present what is JavaScript for Client Side Content Behavior and implementations.
It is not very wise to keep all the codes in one file while developing the web, but because I think that switching between files while explaining the topic will slow down the progress I thought such a structure like this would be more useful. enough to present the logic the rest escapes to overthinking a bit.
The documentation is weak, but it is sufficient for this project, I write regularly and clearly in the projects I will do in the future.
